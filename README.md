### My Rust project
#### author: Marcin Giembicki

I have used simple 2D games engine ggez (good games easily).

Simple Pong game:
- to launch: cargo run
- to exit: you can't
- left player: s - down, w - up
- right player: arrow down - down, arrow up - up
- additional rules: if upon hitting the ball, paddle is moving in the same y-direction as the ball, the ball is sped up, and if ball and paddle are moving in opposite direction -> the ball is slowed down
